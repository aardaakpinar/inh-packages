## ðŸ“¦ How It Works

- Each package is in its own folder with a `package.json` including `"inh": true` and `"main"` fields.
- The INH CLI downloads packages directly from this repository via GitHub raw links.
- Users **cannot upload directly** to this repo; contributions must be made via Pull Requests (PRs).
